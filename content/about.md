## Hello, I'm Patrick üëã
I‚Äôm a dedicated and curious software engineer with a deep passion for technology, mathematics, and systems design. My journey into tech began when I got my first computer (a Tandy 286 running MS-DOS) in the early 90s and quickly became captivated by the possibilities hidden behind the command line. In the early 2000s, as a middle school student, I discovered Linux through Slackware, using it to breathe new life into aging hardware. Before high school, I was diving into networking, setting up LAN parties, and fixing computers for friends and family, always eager to explore how systems worked and how to make them work better.

While technology was my first love, my early 20s led me down a different but equally enriching path. I pursued my interests in art, music, and poetry, performing in the Boston area while working in restaurants and studying for an associate degree in Electrical Engineering Science. This eventually culminated in an opportunity managing a small jazz caf√©, where I took on the roles of equal parts bartender, barista, tapas chef, musical performer and master of ceremonies - a chaotic but rewarding experience that sharpened my ability to adapt, problem-solve, and lead in dynamic environments.

Coming full-circle, my path led me back to technology when I joined Custom Automated Prosthetics (Zahn Dental / Henry Schein) as a CAD/CAM technician. This role opened the door to the tech industry as I transitioned into technical support and hardware repair when Henry Schein acquired the company, assisting dental labs across the U.S. It was here that my love of programming was reignited as I began developing PowerShell scripts to automate key workflows, making my work more efficient and driving real impact.

Determined to push further, I returned to school for Computer Science during the COVID era, focusing on cloud infrastructure, automation, and software development. This led me to Johnson Controls, where I started as a software development intern and worked my way up to Senior DevOps Engineer, delivering solutions at a global scale.

As I continue to evolve in my career, I remain deeply excited about the future of technology, automation, and distributed systems. I‚Äôm passionate about not just keeping up with technological advances but taking an active role in shaping the future‚Äîbuilding innovative solutions that optimize infrastructure, scale globally, and empower the next generation of engineers.

## My Expertise
I specialize in DevOps engineering philosophy, cloud infrastructure, and automation, primarily within the Azure ecosystem. My toolkit includes Terraform for infrastructure-as-code, a preference for GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and Flux for GitOps workflows. I‚Äôm also proficient in Go, Python, and Bash scripting, which enables me to automate and streamline complex processes efficiently.

Beyond cloud and automation, I‚Äôm also comfortable working with embedded platforms and low-level system architecture. I have experience with Yocto for building custom Linux distributions and working with C/C++ for embedded systems and performance-critical applications. My background in hardware, computer science, and system internals gives me a solid understanding of how software and infrastructure interact at a deeper level, allowing me to optimize performance, troubleshoot intricate issues, and build systems that integrate both hardware and software seamlessly.

This ability to work across both high-level cloud environments and low-level embedded platforms gives me a unique perspective‚Äîallowing me to bridge the gap between infrastructure, automation, and system design. Whether I‚Äôm deploying scalable cloud workloads or optimizing firmware for resource-constrained environments, I apply the same core principles: efficiency, reliability, and maintainability.

## My Approach
At the core of my work is a deep commitment to problem solving not just fixing what‚Äôs broken, but understanding the root cause, refining processes, and architecting solutions that stand the test of time. I approach challenges with a blend of pragmatism and curiosity, ensuring that every problem I tackle is an opportunity to improve systems, automate inefficiencies, and create scalable, resilient solutions.

I thrive on continuous learning, always pushing my boundaries to stay ahead of emerging technologies. Whether it‚Äôs infrastructure as code, Kubernetes orchestration, or optimizing CI/CD pipelines, I take a hands-on approach‚Äîexperimenting, iterating, and refining until I find the most effective solution.

Clean code, effective automation, and thoughtful system architecture form the foundation of my work. I believe that great engineering isn‚Äôt just about making things work‚Äîit‚Äôs about making them work reliably, efficiently, and with minimal friction. I‚Äôm a firm advocate for clear documentation, because knowledge-sharing and maintainability are just as crucial as the code itself.

What truly drives me is the elegance of simplicity, breaking down complex problems into clear, understandable, and repeatable solutions. Whether it‚Äôs debugging a stubborn issue, streamlining workflows, or designing robust cloud infrastructure, I approach every challenge with a strategic mindset, ensuring that solutions are not just functional but also sustainable and adaptable for the future.

Ultimately, I see technology as a force multiplier that, when harnessed thoughtfully, empowers teams, optimizes efficiency, and paves the way for innovation at scale. üöÄ

## My Projects
Throughout my career, I have led the charge in modernizing legacy systems, transitioning critical services from brittle, outdated setups to scalable, automated, and cloud-native architectures. I specialize in revitalizing legacy codebases, leveraging my deep understanding of Linux internals and system architecture‚Äîa skillset shaped by my early experiences with Slackware and breathing new life into aging hardware. This foundation has made me particularly adept at navigating, troubleshooting, and optimizing older codebases, identifying bottlenecks, and gradually evolving them toward modern DevOps best practices.

I‚Äôve successfully executed large-scale migrations, including:

Replatforming legacy monolithic applications onto Kubernetes-based deployments, improving scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

Modernizing CI/CD pipelines by replacing manual or ad-hoc deployment processes with automated, repeatable workflows using GitHub Actions.

Developing Terraform modules to create robust, reusable Azure infrastructure, ensuring environments are consistent, secure, and scalable.

Implementing GitOps workflows with Flux, bringing declarative infrastructure and application management to teams embracing continuous delivery.

What sets me apart is my ability to jump into complex, unfamiliar legacy systems, understanding their intricacies, improving them incrementally, and guiding organizations through a structured migration. Whether it‚Äôs refactoring ancient shell scripts, debugging deeply embedded C++ code, or containerizing legacy services, I excel at bridging the gap between old and new. My goal is always to leave things better than I found them, building sustainable, forward-thinking solutions that empower teams and drive long-term efficiency.

## My Goals
Looking ahead, I'm deeply interested in quantum computing, embedded systems, and advanced hardware projects, particularly focusing on how these areas intersect with DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. My goal is to deepen my understanding and expertise in integrating these technologies, continually broadening my skill set to build robust, efficient, and innovative solutions that bridge traditional DevOps practices with emerging hardware and software paradigms.

I‚Äôm always looking to expand my skill set and stay ahead of emerging technologies. Lately, I‚Äôve been particularly interested in:
